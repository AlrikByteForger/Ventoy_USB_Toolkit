## .gitignore (copy/paste)

This one is intentionally “paranoid” so you don’t accidentally commit ISOs, WinPE, MediCat, etc. You can loosen later if you *intentionally* want to track something.

```gitignore
# ============================
# Safety: DO NOT COMMIT BINARIES / ISOs
# ============================
